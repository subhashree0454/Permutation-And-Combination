Here are the answers to your questions:

### 1. Seating Delegates with Two Together
To treat the two particular delegates as a single unit:
- This gives us 24 units to arrange (the pair + 23 others).
- Arrangements = \(23! \times 2!\) (because the pair can be arranged in 2 ways).

**Answer:** **B. 2! × 23!**

---

### 2. Seating 5 Boys and 4 Girls Alternately
Since there are more boys than girls, the arrangement starts and ends with a boy:
- There are 5 boys arranged in \(5!\) ways and 4 girls arranged in \(4!\) ways.

**Answer:** **C. 4! × 5!**

---

### 3. Arranging the Letters of "LEADER"
The word "LEADER" has 6 letters with 'E' repeating twice:
\[
\text{Arrangements} = \frac{6!}{2!} = \frac{720}{2} = 360
\]

**Answer:** **C. 360**

### 4. Drawing 3 Balls with at Least One Black Ball
Total combinations minus those without black balls:
1. Total ways to choose 3 balls from 9 (2 white + 3 black + 4 red):
   \[
   \binom{9}{3} = 84
   \]
2. Combinations with no black balls (only from white and red):
   \[
   \binom{6}{3} = 20
   \]
3. Therefore, combinations with at least one black ball:
   \[
   84 - 20 = 64
   \]

**Answer:** **C. 64**

### 5. Forming Numbers Greater than a Million
Valid combinations (cannot start with 0):
1. Choose a leading digit from {2, 3, 4} (3 choices).
2. Arrange the remaining 6 digits.

Total arrangements considering the repetition of '3':
\[
\text{Permutations} = \frac{6!}{4!} = 30
\]
Thus, total combinations:
\[
3 \times 30 = 90
\]
**Answer:** **Not directly listed, please check calculations.**

### 6. Choosing Stationery Items
Choices for writing a letter:
- 6 types of note papers, 7 types of ink-stands, 4 types of pens:

---

### 7. Different Words from "SCISSORS"
The word "SCISSORS" has 8 letters with 'S' repeated 3 times:
\[
\text{Arrangements} = \frac{8!}{3!} = \frac{40320}{6} = 6720

**Answer:** **None of these (since options do not reflect correct calculation).**

---

### 8. Traveling in Two Cars
Choosing 5 students for the first car from 8:
\[
\text{Ways to choose} = \binom{8}{5} = 56
\]
Arranging them:
\[
5! \text{ (for car 1)} \times 3! \text{ (for car 2)} = 56 \times 120 \times 6 = 40320
\]

**Answer:** **D. 3920**

---

### 9. Posting 10 Letters in 5 Post Boxes

**Answer:** **A) 5^{10}**

---

### 10. Seating 15 People at Two Round Tables
Choose 8 people for one table (the rest go to the other):

**Answer:** **D. 2*(15C7)*6!*7!**

---

### 11. Arranging EDUCATION with Relative Positions
There are 4 vowels (E, U, A, I) and 5 consonants:

\]

**Answer:** **C. 4! × 5!**

---

### 12. Arranging Brothers with One Person Between

**Answer:** **A) 2 * 19!**

---

### 13. Selecting Principal and Vice-Principals

\]

**Answer:** **B. 12**

---

### 14. Seating 5 Friends for a Photograph
5 friends can be arranged in 5 chairs:
